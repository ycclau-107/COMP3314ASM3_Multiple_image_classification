# COMP3314_Machine_Learning

## Aims and Objective of the Course
The course is for the student to obtain an introductory understanding of algorithms and applications of machine learning. Topics include:
1. Decision theory; 
2. Parametric models;
3. Supervised learning(classification and regression); 
4. Unsupervised learning(clustering, mixture models, principal component analysis); 
5. Bayesian methods.

The objective of this course are to let student to:-
1. understantd the motivations and principles for building adaptive systems based on empirical data, and how machine learning relates to the broader field of artificial intelligence; and
2. formulate problems associated with domains specific data(e.g.: image classification, document clustering) in terms of abstract models of machine learning; and
3. implement solutions to machine learning problems using tools such as Matlab or Octave, apply numerical optimization algorithms.
